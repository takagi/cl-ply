# Cl-Ply

A library to handle PLY file format which is known as the Polygon File Format or the Stanford Triangle Format in Common Lisp.

## Usage

I will fill this section later.

## Installation

Since cl-ply is not available in Quicklisp yet, please use Quicklisp's local-projects feature to use it.

    $ cd ~/quicklisp/local-projects
    $ git clone git://github.com/takagi/cl-ply.git

Then `(ql:quickload :cl-ply)` from `REPL` to load it.

I will apply registering cl-ply to Quicklisp later. After it will be accepted, you will be able to load cl-ply just `(ql:quickload :cl-ply)` only.
